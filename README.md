# VitalPresets

My Vital presets. Most of these are made by me, some are recreations of YouTube videos, a small handful are from other free packs or are tweaks of ones from other free packs.

Lots of Drum and Bass/Trap/Noise/"Bass Music"/IDK. Some utilities (white noise risers, sirens, textures), lots of wubs and wobbles. Some listening to tracks then trying to steal the synth.
